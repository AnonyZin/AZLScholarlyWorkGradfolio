**Scholarship -**
As a doctoral student within the University of Central Florida's [Texts and Technology](https://cah.ucf.edu/textstech/) program, I specialize in Technical Communication. Through tech comm, my research interests center around historical and modern domestic texts as technical documentation. This research includes topics of history, culinary arts, digital humanities, gender, foodways, labor, home economics, domesticity, and digital curation.  I aim to explore expanded concepts of technical communication that are more inclusive and to illuminate the invisible work and technical documentation creation that homemakers do which makes this labor more visible to more people.

**Made-Of-All-Work -**
This is a play on the historical term, "maid-of-all-work", a 19th-century phrase that referred to women who completed all sorts of varying housework. I have replaced the word *maid* with *made*, as *maid* may indicate a servant, which women are not.  *Made* is more appropriate as household labor involves much making, for instance in the form of cookery and the domestic technical documents that are created and used to instruct on it.  The term created is also a reclamation of a virginal label applied to those who labor in household management, care, reproduction, and other domestic pursuits. The use of the word *made* also reflects my scholarly interest and work in critical making.

**Background -**
I received my Bachelor of Business Administration in Marketing from the University of Texas at San Antonio and spent several years working for The Walt Disney Company in a variety of positions including roles within Global Consumer Insights and Research. I then received my Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the University of Central Florida. After working as an executive in corporate healthcare, I earned a GradCert in Professional Writing and Master of Arts in English with a Technical Writing specialization while working as a market researcher and writer. I am currently a graduate student in UCF's Texts and Technology program.
