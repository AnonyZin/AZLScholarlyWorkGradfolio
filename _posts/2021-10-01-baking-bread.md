### ABSTRACT ###
It is the intention of this abstract to do research that explores a history of domestic technical figures from the 19th to the 21st centuries to consider previously overlooked technical documentation in what has been known as “women's work.” This technical communications research is being conducted with considerations of gender theory, rhetorical theory, and usability. It spotlights historically unconsidered technical communication documents as legitimate technical communication, specifically within the genre of cookery books. The importance of documenting these histories is addressed and recipes are followed through the history of American cookery publications to exemplify the progression of domestic technical figures from the 1800s and into the digital age. Plaited bread is selected for this task, bread being one of the oldest domestic technologies. Technical figures are evaluated based on Method of Figure Creation, Clarity, Style, and Appropriateness and general conclusions are then presented along with calls for additional research.
